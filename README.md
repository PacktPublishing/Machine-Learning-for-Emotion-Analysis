## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pandas as pd
data_file_path = "EI-reg-En-anger-train.txt"
df = pd.read_csv(data_file_path, sep='\t')
# drop rows where the emotion is not strong
df[df['Intensity Score'] <= 0.2]
```
