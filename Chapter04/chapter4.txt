This file contains some exercises associated with the topics discussed
in Chapter 4. Some of these exercises go beyond the material in
Chapter 4: in particular, we didn't say all that much about tagging
and parsing there, because we concluded that it was too difficult to
parse tweets in a way that was actually useful. Nonetheless, it is
worth including some examples of taggers and parsers here so that
people can try them out for themselves. It is one thing for us to say
that we don't think they're all that useful for the task addressed in
the book, but readers may want to try them out for themselves.

DATASETS
We use a number of datasets in this book. Some of them are freely
available, some are freely downloadable but have licences or terms and
conditions that restrict what you can do with them, some you have to
pay for. We provide tools to download most of the freely available
onesand unpack them in the format that we want and put them in the
place we want. However, for the ones that have licences that restrict
what you can do with them we ask you to check the licence details to
confirm that what you are going to do with them is permitted. The
first two that we will be using are the British National Corpus (BNC)
and the universal dependency treebank (UDT).

READERS
In the book we introduce the notion of "readers" -- objects that will
read text (possibly with annotations) and return it in a format that
suits the current task, whatever that may be.

In the book we looked at readers for two corpora, the BNC and the
PATB. These are, unfortunately, subject to licensing restrictions
which mean that we cannot distribute them here. The BNC is freely
downloadable, but the licence
http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/licence.html explicitly says

    The BNC Consortium does not grant to the Licensee any rights
    whatsover to reproduce the BNC Texts or use all or any part of the
    BNC Texts in commercial products or services

i.e. that we cannot distribute it. We can point to where you can
download it from, and we can provide code which will download it and
unpack to the place where our programs need it to be. You can get
directly from
https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2554,
or you can use our downloader:

This will put the BNC in a directory with the following structure
inside CORPORA/TEXTS, where the actual data is in files inside A0, A1, ..,

TAGGING
We will consider three taggers -- a very simple one that just uses
word frequencies, an HMM-based one which pays attention to the
